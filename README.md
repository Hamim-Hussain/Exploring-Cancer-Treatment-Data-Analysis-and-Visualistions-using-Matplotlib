## Introduction 
In this project, I analysed an animal study on potential skin cancer treatments. 249 mice received various regimens, observing tumor development over 45 days. My roles were to: generate tables, figures, and a summary.

Tasked with data prep, I merged mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames. Identifying duplicates, I created a clean DataFrame. Generating statistics, I calculated mean, median, variance, SD, and SEM for each drug regimen. Bar charts display row counts per regimen using both Pandas and Matplotlib. I also visualised gender distribution through pie charts.

For four treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin), I calculated final tumor volume, quartiles, IQR, and potential outliers. I created box plots to highlight outliers. A line plot showcases tumor volume over time for a specific mouse treated with Capomulin. A scatter plot reveals the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Lastly, I calculated the correlation coefficient and plot a linear regression model for mouse weight and tumor volume.
